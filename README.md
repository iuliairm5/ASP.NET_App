# ASP.NET_App

-	an application using ASP.NET Core 6.X (C# based) allowing users to perform CRUD operations on two related classes (ex: Product-Category);
-	I have included some authentication (with locking the user out for 30 min after 5 unsuccessful attempts),
role-based authorization, SSL (redirect HTTP to HTTPS) and forms protected against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks
